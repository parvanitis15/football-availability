## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

The app uses Supabase for real-time data sync. You'll need to:

1. Create tables in your Supabase project:

```sql
-- Create matches table
CREATE TABLE matches (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create availability table
CREATE TABLE availability (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id BIGINT REFERENCES matches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(match_id, player_name)
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE matches ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE availability ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies to allow all operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on matches" ON matches FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on availability" ON availability FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Enable real-time
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE matches;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE availability;
```

2. Update the Supabase credentials in `index.html`:
   - Replace `SUPABASE_URL` with your project URL
   - Replace `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your anon key

## üîß Customization

### Admin Passwords
Update the `ADMIN_PASSWORDS` array in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const ADMIN_PASSWORDS = ['your_password1', 'your_password2', 'your_password3'];
